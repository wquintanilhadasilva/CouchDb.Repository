# HOW TO USE

I apologize for not having a complete and nice documentation, I'm kind of out of time to do it to the standard that the community deserves, a lot of work on a daily basis.

However, until the documentation is ready, to learn how to use the framework, please see the usage examples in the ApplicationConsole and WebApplication projects in this repository.

**See the pdf document below [doc.pdf](doc.pdf) for details on how to configure and use this framework (it is very simple and easy), until I manage to dedicate time to document here on the MD about all the existing resources as well as the restrictions.**
